## Bun program

To install dependencies **DO NOT FORGET TO TURN-OFF Z-SCALER**:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Testing Site

The testing site is a react project with tailwindcss, daisyui, and vite. It uses npm for package management since I figured that would be the most universal way of doing it.

```bash
cd ./testing-site
npm install
```

To run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

There should already be plenty of accessibility violations cuz I went out of my way to create as many issues as I could. But feel free to add as many as you'd like for testing purposes.
